## Data Sources
We are curating a list of data sources, currently located [here](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/USAvian/blob/master/data/data_sources.csv). Import this file as an object to easily retrieve the URL for relevant information.  

```{r data_source_table}
sources <- read.csv(here("data_raw/data_sources.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
abbrevs <- c("bcr_v10", )
```
This data table comprises abbreviations for ease of downloading.

## county boundaries
usa_counties <- plot_usmap(regions="counties")+
  labs(title="US Counties, US Census Bureau (YYYY)")

# for specific regions, see https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf 
## southeast

  labs(title = "Southeastern US",
       subtitle = "States in the Southeastern US")

## or use the usmap to grab predefined census regions

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
