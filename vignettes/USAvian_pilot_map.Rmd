## Data Sources
We are curating a list of data sources, currently located [here](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/USAvian/blob/master/data/data_sources.csv). Import this file as an object to easily retrieve the URL for relevant information.  

```{r data_source}
#define the abbreviations corresponding to the data of interest
abbrevs <- c("bcr_persistent", "iba")
# Available abbreviations can be found using:
data("data_sources")
unique(data_sources$abbrev)
```

Next, download the data. This function will not overwrite existing files with the same names. 
```{r download_data, include=FALSE}
download_data(abbrevs=abbrevs, dir= here("data/data-raw")) # this will create a new directory if it does not already exist
list.files(here("data/data-raw")) # check to see which files are now in this dir..
```
Next, import selected data into memory.
```{r import_data}

```

## USA Base Map
Create the base map for adding layers
```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# in 2019 package usmap used US Census county boundaries
## state boundaries
usa_states <- plot_usmap(regions="states")+
  labs(title="US States, US Census Bureau (YYYY)")

## county boundaries
usa_counties <- plot_usmap(regions="counties")+
  labs(title="US Counties, US Census Bureau (YYYY)")

# for specific regions, see https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf 
## southeast
usa_se <- plot_usmap(include = c("FL", "GA", "MS", "SC", "NC", "AL", "AR", "LA", "TN")) +
  labs(title = "Southeastern US",
       subtitle = "States in the Southeastern US")

## or use the usmap to grab predefined census regions
# usa_sa <- usmap::plot_usmap(include = .south_atlantic)
# usa_s <- usmap::plot_usmap(include = .south_region)
```
```{r data_struc_usamap, include=FALSE}
str(usmap::us_map())
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
