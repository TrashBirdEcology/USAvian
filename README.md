# USAvian
A collection of collections. A list of lists. A map of maps. A one-stop shop for entities directly or indirectly doing bird conservation and management.


## About
Out of frustration of trying to build mental maps of what groups, cooperatives, federal agencies are "doing" bird conservation, I'd like to compile as comprehensive of a list as possible. Should the list become interesting enough, I envision some sort of interactive map comprising these entities, which can be subsetted or filtered at various scales, or via other characteristics. Further, the visualization service might also include direct links to conservation initiatives or papertrails, management outcomes, or relevant research articles.
